/**
 * One of the on-device LLM variants ZeroAI can run via LiteRT-LM.
 *
 * The picker on the Agents-tab on-device screen surfaces these by id;
 * the downloader fetches [downloadUrl] into `filesDir/models/<id>.litertlm`,
 * and the daemon-lifecycle wiring loads the file with the right backend
 * when the daemon starts.
 *
 * Sizes and memory numbers come from the official `litert-community`
 * Hugging Face model cards (verified May 2026); they're shown to the
 * user verbatim in the picker so they can pick within their device's
 * RAM budget.
 *
 * @property id Stable identifier used in storage paths and selection state.
 * @property displayName Human-readable name shown in the picker.
 * @property variantNote Short tagline describing the trade-off
 *   ("speed" / "quality" / "long context").
 * @property contextTokens Token budget handed to the engine as
 *   `maxNumTokens`; it bounds the KV-cache allocation and therefore
 *   the GPU working-memory peak. Usually the model's native context
 *   window, but may be capped below it to keep a heavier variant
 *   within the device's memory budget.
 * @property fileBytes Size of the `.litertlm` file the downloader fetches.
 * @property workingMemoryBytes Steady-state GPU working memory required
 *   during inference, per the Hugging Face model card.
 * @property downloadUrl Direct HTTPS download URL on Hugging Face. The
 *   `litert-community` repos are un-gated as of May 2026 — no login needed.
 * @property risk Severity badge for the RAM/power warning UI.
