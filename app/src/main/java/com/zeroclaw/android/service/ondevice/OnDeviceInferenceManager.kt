     * Single load entry point. Called by
     * [com.zeroclaw.android.service.ZeroAIDaemonService] before the
     * daemon writes its TOML so the loopback HTTP server is up by
     * the time channels start polling.
     *
     * Behaviour:
     *  - Returns [EngineReadiness.NotConfigured] when the active row
     *    isn't on-device-large or the model file isn't on disk.
     *  - Returns [EngineReadiness.Ready] when the engine is loaded
     *    against the active variant — either because it already was,
     *    or because this call just loaded it.
     *  - Returns [EngineReadiness.Failed] when the load attempt hit
     *    a terminal error (GPU init refused, file corrupted, …).
     *
     * Variant swaps are handled inline: if the engine is already
     * Loaded against a different variant, the prior engine is torn
     * down and the requested variant loaded fresh.
     *
     * Holds [mutex] for the full load — concurrent callers (a daemon
     * restart racing a model-swap from the picker UI) serialise
     * cleanly. There is no separate reactive loader to race against;
     * the reconciler is unload-only.
